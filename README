== id3lib README

  id3lib is a library which wraps the C++ libid3
  library and exposes it's methods to Ruby.

  My aim in writing the library was to have it as
  easy to use and natural as possible, without
  having to deal with the cumbersome nature of the
  actually id3 tags/frames/fields paradigm.

  I feel I've succeeded for the most part, and believe 
  the library to have the most complete implementation
  of the id3 specification available to Ruby.

  The latest version  of this library can be found
  at http://www.stitt.org/code/


== Usage

  	require 'id3lib'

  	tag=ID3lib.new( 'test.mp3' )
	File.open( 'cover.jpg' ) do | file |
		pic=tag.add_picture( file.read )
                pic.depicts=ID3lib::Picture::FRONT_COVER
                pic.description='A Test Picture of nothing'
        end
        tag.title='Test Song'
        tag.save
